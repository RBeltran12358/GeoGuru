Final Update:

I do not believe there were any changes from our midterm report. We were able to complete all of the objectives that we laid out in the midterm report.

We were able to complete the data flow between pages, aggregation of the quiz data, and proper answer checking and scoring. We were also able to implement one of our reach features in displaying all of the users incorrect answers/questions on the quiz summary page alongside the correct answer. 

No features were dropped since the midterm report, but if we had the additional time to continue working we would have liked to have tackled a few more of the "reach features" such as searching for quizzes and other quiz option categories/filters. If this app were to be scaled up significantly and we added a lot more quizzes of much longer lengths it may have been worth it to rearrange out data management of the quiz content or even use question templates alongside API calls to populate question info. In the current version of our code, however, this would be neither necessary nor efficient.

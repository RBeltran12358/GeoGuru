Final Update:

I do not believe there were any changes from our midterm report. We were able to complete all fo the objectives that we laid out in the midterm report.

We were able to complete the data flow between pages, aggregation of the quiz data, and proper answer checking and scoring. We were also able to implement one of our reach features in displaying all of the users incorrect answers on the quiz summary page. 

No features were dropped since the midterm report, but if we had the additional time to continue working we would have liked to have tackled a few more of the reach features such as searching for quizzes and other quiz option categories/filters.
